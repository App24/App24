I'm Ricardo Xavier, I am a graduate from Anglia Ruskin University, I studied Computer Games Technology and graduated with a First Class Honours.

I have an interest in any programming related project, from making games to making programming languages and OS's.

I have 8+ years of self-taught knowledge on many topics and programming languages, including C#, Javascript/Typescript and Python.<br>
I am currently looking into, learning and experimenting with the Rust programming language.
