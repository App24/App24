I'm Ricardo Xavier, I am currently a university student studying Computer Games Technology.

I have an interest in any programming related project, from making games to making programming languages and OS's.

I have 6+ years of self-taught knowledge on many topics and programming languages, including C#, Javascript/Typescript and Python.
